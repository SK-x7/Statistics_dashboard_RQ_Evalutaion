I was assigned a task by a company for the role of Full Stack Developer to build a React dashboard for displaying business statistics within 3 days. The key requirements were:

Work with JSON-formatted data to perform statistical analysis.
Use React charts or any other chart and graph library to visualize the data on the frontend.
Make the dashboard visually appealing.
What I Learned: I learned how to efficiently calculate statistics using MongoDB aggregation methods and JavaScript.

Although I completed the task, I was not selected. The backend and frontend worked well, but I struggled with the design aspect, which affected the overall outcome.
